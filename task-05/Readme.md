Before starting the problem I checked out the RESOURCES.md file. I just quickly went through the mentioned Python packages and libraries like requests, json, threading,and time from the links given in the file.I spent more time in learning time and threading. Then I started writing each functions mentioned in TimeTickQuix.py. This probem gaveme a good introduction to api and different functions in time and threading.It helped me learn the logic and proper usage of these functions while writing the code.I manually tested the code via CLI(command line interface) and simulated timer runs. After completing the code and checking the working i then started decorating the interface.
