This task helped me understand how to create and program discord bots using the discord.py library. I began by watching several tutorials and exploring the official discord.py documentation to learn the basics. Through this, I gained experience writing bot commands and handling various events within discord. I used apis like Musicbrainz.api and LRClib.api to fetch json data. I found it a bit challenging to collect specific datas from the apis but it helped me practice data structures.
