I first cloned the repository into my device.

Part 1:

I used cd Terminal-Hunt/ to change my directory to Terminal-Hunt. 
I used grep function to find which file had the 'facility'. git grep -ril 'facility'. I found out that it was stored in Earth/Russia/Vladimir_Oblast/.facility/gravity_equation.txt

I used cd function and used cat function to read gravity_equation.txt

You’ve uncovered the first piece of the puzzle — well done, explorer.

The string: T25lIGxhc3QgdGFzaywgYW5kIHlvdSdsbCBoYXZlIHN1Y2Nlc3NmdWxseSBjb21

Its meaning holds power... and danger.
Now that the facility has fulfilled its purpose, it's time to cover your tracks, erase it.  
Wipe it from existence so no one — and nothing — can trace your path.
The future depends on secrecy.

Part 2:

I went back to the root directory by using cd ~ and went to Saturn using cd .Then I used ch to go the Ring. I used ls -a to find the hidden .sh file .
to make the file executable i used chmod +x .wormhole.sh. Then i executed it using ./.wormhole

Well done, traveller
You've managed to breach the distortions near Saturn's ring and accessed the wormhole node
This is your second key wbGV0ZWQgdGhlIFRlcm1pbmFsIEh1bnQhIFJ1biBncmF2aXR5
But now, your mission isn't just to discover... it's to protect
Back up the solutions.md to the safest place you know
And what could be safer than your Home Sweet Home
Copy it to the directory that shares the name of your state and also take a screenshot of this output


Part 3:

I entered into a new branch Gargantuan System using git checkout  GargantuaSystem

I entered each Planets and used find . -type f -iname "*habitable*" to find the hidden branch . I used cd to go into the hidden branch and used cat to real .HABITABLE.txt

Congrats! You have found the one and only planet humans can thrive in. Here's its genetic code:
